# Revolution OS Blueprint

The typical operating system experience is defined by apps. Most tech companies have their own apps for everything—from social networks to stocks, to media players, and so on. If you want to talk to your friends, but they're all on different messaging platforms, you have to open several different apps to reach them. Additionally, if you want a simple OS that works for you out of the box, you usually have to sacrifice your freedom to do whatever you want with your computer. You can certainly install a Linux distribution and regain that freedom, but that often means sacrificing much of the simplicity you get from OSes like Windows or macOS. In our opinion, this is unintuitive and unacceptable.

What if we told you there's a better way? A way for you to talk to your friends from the comfort of a single app, regardless of the platform they're using? A way for you to do whatever you want with your computer without sacrificing the simplicity that enables even your grandma to use it with no problems? A system that respects your privacy so much that everything you'd ever need to safeguard your identity is built directly into the OS?

This is Revolution OS—a future-proof operating system that seeks to completely change the way we use modern devices. In this document, we'll take you on a tour of this theoretical OS and show you everything we plan to do with it. We hope to win you over to this new way of personal and business computing!

## The GUI Experience

Let's start by talking about the first thing you see when you turn your computer on—the graphical user interface. Almost every modern device in the world has one, from the beige box under your desk to the phone in your hand, to the grocery store kiosk you curse at when it inevitably mis-scans your credit card for the fifth time in a row. It's the reason you don't have to learn text commands like:

```bash
mv /home/prefect/documents/how_long_you_last_in_space.mp3 /home/prefect/music/how_long_you_last_in_space.mp3
```

Instead, you can drag and drop everything you need anywhere on your computer or phone.

Every operating system has its own GUI, and they all vary greatly from each other. If you've only used a Windows computer all your life, you're going to have quite a bit of trouble getting used to macOS or Android. Conversely, most Linux distributions have similar options available when it comes to GUIs. Unfortunately, it gets complicated because there are several different desktops you can install on Linux, and just like Windows or macOS, they are very different from each other. What makes it even more complicated is that they often lack documentation. In fact, until recently, there wasn't much available in terms of solid guides for Linux, and that still holds true to a certain extent today. This is what makes Linux such a pain for regular users who just want a system that works for them.

To that end, Revolution OS will have one built-in desktop that is not meant to be swapped out with another, in order to ensure simplicity for users. However, that does not necessarily mean we intend to force users into a single GUI that they cannot change in any way. In fact, Garrett has come up with an idea to allow people to customize the interface however they want.

The system Garrett proposes is a highly extensible theming system. In this proposal, the OS would come with a built-in theme editor that allows you to customize the layout of everything, all while requiring no coding skills. Our idea is that the default look will be a top bar and a desktop at the bottom, similar to most Linux distributions. However, if a user wants a bottom taskbar similar to Windows, all they would need to do is open our theme editor, drag everything where they want it to go, then save their custom theme. From there, they would be able to share their themes with other users freely, should they wish to do so.

This system would also allow users to define custom menu structures. For example, if you want the Windows/Super key to launch a menu with pinned tiles and an "everything" button, like the classic Windows XP/7 Start Menu, you can set it up that way. Gone are the days where you cannot work with your system because the interface is inflexible to your needs.
