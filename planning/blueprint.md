# Revolution OS Blueprint

The typical operating system experience is defined by apps. Most tech companies have their own apps for everything—from social networks to stocks, to media players, and so on. If you want to talk to your friends, but they're all on different messaging platforms, you have to open several different apps to talk to them all. In addition, if you want a simple OS that works for you out of the box, you usually have to sacrifice your freedom to do whatever you want with your computer. You can certainly install a Linux distribution and gain that freedom back, but that means sacrificing much of the simplicity you get from OSes like Windows or macOS. In our opinion, this is wildly unintuitive and unacceptable.

What if we told you there's a better way? A way for you to talk to your friends from the comfort of a single app, regardless of the platform they're using? A way for you to do whatever you want with your computer without sacrificing the simplicity that enables even your grandma to use it with no problems? A system that respects your privacy so much that everything you'd ever need to safeguard your identity is built directly into the OS?

This is Revolution OS—a future-proof operating system that seeks to completely change the way we use modern devices. In this document, we'll take you on a tour of this theoretical OS and show you everything we plan to do with it. We hope we can win you over to this new way of personal and business computing!

## The GUI Experience

Let's start by talking about the first thing you see when you turn your computer on—the graphical user interface. Almost every modern device in the world has one, from the beige box under your desk, to the phone in your hand, to the grocery store keyosk you curse at when it inevitably miss-scans your creddit card for the 5th time in a row. It's the reason you don't have to learn text commands like:
```Bash
mv /home/prefect/documents/how_long_you_last_in_space.mp3 /home/prefect/music/how_long_you_last_in_space.mp3
```
And you can drag and drop everything you need to anywhere on your computer/phone.

Every operating system has its own GUI, and they all vary greatly from each other. If you've only used a Windows computer all you're life, you're going to have quite a bit of trouble getting used to Mac OS or Android. Conversely, most Linux distros have the same options available when it comes to GUIs. Unfortunately, where it get complicated is that there are several different desktops you can install on Linux, and just like Windows/Mac, they are very different from each other. What makes it even more complicated is that they don't come with much documentation if any. In fact, until recently, there wasn't much available in terms of solid guides for Linux, and that still holds true to a certain extent today. This is what makes Linux such a pain for regular users who just want a system that works for them.

To that end, Revolution OS will have one built-in desktop that is not meant to be swapped out with another, in order to insure simplisity for users. However, that does not necessarily mean we intend on forcing users into a single GUI that they cannot change in any way. In fact, Garrett has come up with an idea to allow people to customize the interface however they want.
